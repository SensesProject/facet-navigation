All  pathways  fulfill  these  objectives by reaching specific and clear targets. For example, they all limit the future global mean temperature increase to not more than 2°C above preindustrial levels, and they all lead to almost universal access to  clean  energy  services  throughout  the  world  by  2030.  Another  feature  common  to  all  pathways  is  that  all  economic  and  demographic  changes  within  them  are  consistent  with  the  GEA’s  aspirational  goals  with respect to sustainable development. \n\nThree  GEA  pathway groups, labeled GEA-Efficiency, GEA-Mix, and GEA-Supply, are constructed  to  represent  different  emphases  in  terms  of  demand-side  and  supply-side  changes.  Each  group  varies  in  particular  with  respect  to  assumptions  about  the  comprehensiveness  of  demand-side  policies  to enhance efficiency, leading to pathways of comparatively low energy demand  (GEA-Efficiency),  intermediate  demand  (GEA-Mix),  and  high  demand  (GEA-Supply). Within  each  group,  a  range  of  alternative  pathways  for  the  supply-side  transformation  are  explored.  The sceanrio setup therefore results in three general branching points:\n1.        Energy demand level:\n           •        GEA-Efficiency (low demand)\n           •        GEA-Supply (high demand)\n           •        GEA-Mix (intermediate demand)\n2.

In particular, maximum daily discharge was adjusted, with a multi-model averaged reduction in bias over about 2/3 of the analysed basin area.

In the reference case, global energy intensity is following broadly historical rates of improvement, leading to an increase in global energy demand by about a factor of two in 2050. The second scenario is a low energy demand case broadly consistent with the lower bound of demand projections in the literature, depicting stringent efficiency measures and behavioral changes to radically limit energy demand. The rate of energy intensity improvement in the low demand scenario is about 50% higher than the historical rate of changeIn addition to sensitivity cases for energy demand, we explore the feasibility of the transformation for a variety of different supply-side portfolios.

The projected population growth will lead to even more severe effects. \" (Schewe et al., PNAS, 2014)",

Uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects [...] show that further research is urgently needed to better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production and to devise targeted adaptation strategies.\" (Rosenzweig et al., PNAS, 2014)",

Seven global vegetation models are used to analyze possible responses to future climate simulated by a range of general circulation models run under all four representative concentration pathway scenarios of changing concentrations of greenhouse gases. All 110 simulations predict an increase in global vegetation carbon to 2100, but with substantial variation between vegetation models. For example, at 4 °C of global land surface warming (510–758 ppm of CO2), vegetation carbon increases by 52–477 Pg C (224 Pg C mean), mainly due to CO2 fertilization of photosynthesis. Simulations agree on large regional increases across much of the boreal forest, western Amazonia, central Africa, western China, and southeast Asia, with reductions across southwestern North America, central South America, southern Mediterranean areas, southwestern Africa, and southwestern Australia. Four vegetation models display discontinuities across 4 °C of warming, indicating global thresholds in the balance of positive and negative influences on productivity and biomass. Effects that counter CO2 fertilization are, among others, increased rates of evaporation or stomatal closure due to higher vapor pressure deficits. In contrast to previous global vegetation model studies, we emphasize the importance of uncertainties in projected changes in carbon residence times. We find, when all seven models are considered for one representative concentration pathway × general circulation model combination, such uncertainties explain 30% more variation in modeled vegetation carbon change than responses of net primary productivity alone, increasing to 151% for non-HYBRID4 models. A change in research priorities away from production and toward structural dynamics and demographic processes is recommended.\" Land use changes which are driven by demographic developments are also a major factor in determining future global vegetation and its role in the Earth system. Furthermore demographic prodesses also influence the global carbon balance. (Friend et al., PNAS, 2014)",

The model outputs indicate a net increase in the annual person-months at risk when comparing from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 from the 2050s to the 2080s.

Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply.

Additional policies and measures are required to fully implement the NDCs, which would reduce emissions by 7 to 17 GtCO2eq.The emissions gap in 2030 between planned national policies and a well below 2°C trajectory are 9 to 37 Gt. For a 1.5°C trajectory there is a gap of 17 to 43 Gt. ",
        "Kriegler et al.: Although countries differ considerably in the sectoral composition of emission reductions, a robust pattern emerges, with an almost complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 that is accompanied by accelerated electrification and a limited reduction of carbon intensity of fuel consumption in the industry, buildings and transport sectors.",
        "Krey et al.: Climate policies to achieve 1.5 and 2C potentially create both synergies and trade-offs with other SDGs, highlighting that integrated policy approaches are needed to ensure multiple SDGs are achieved simultaneously. In particular, dealing with undesirable distributional consequences of climate policies is key to avoid negative impacts on the poor, like ensuring food security and access to modern energy services.",
        "McCollum et al.: The Nationally Determined Contributions lack the pronounced reallocation of the investment portfolio needed for transforming the energy system. Charting a course toward ‘well below 2 °C’ instead requires that low-carbon investments overtake fossil investments globally before 2025 and then continue to grow from there. Pursuing the 1.5 °C target demands a marked up-scaling in low-carbon capital beyond that demanded by 2 °C. The investment needs for making progress on certain other SDG targets are small relative to those for energy."

        "The influence of economic growth and fossil resource assumptions on climate mitigation pathways is relatively small due to overriding requirements imposed by long-term climate targets. \nWhile baseline assumptions can have substantial effects on mitigation costs and carbon prices, we find that the effects of model differences and the stringency of the climate target are larger compared to that of baseline assumptions. \nWe conclude that inherent uncertainties about socio-economic determinants like economic growth and fossil resource availability can be effectively dealt with in the assessment of mitigation pathways. (Kriegler et al. overview)",
        "We find that after a deferral of ambitious action the 450 ppm CO2e is only achievable with a radical up-scaling of efforts after target adoption. This has severe effects on transformation pathways and exacerbates the challenges of climate stabilization, in particular for a delay of cooperative action until 2030. Specifically, reaching the target with weak near-term action implies (a) faster and more aggressive transformations of energy systems in the medium term, (b) more stranded investments in fossil-based capacities, (c) higher long-term mitigation costs and carbon prices and (d) stronger transitional economic impacts, rendering the political feasibility of such pathways questionable. (Luderer et al.)",
        "Achieving ambitious climate targets will drastically reduce fossil fuel consumption, in particular the consumption of coal. Conventional oil and gas as well as non-conventional oil reserves are still exhausted to a large extent. \nWe find the net present value of fossil fuel rent until 2100 at 30tril.US$ with a large share of oil and a small share of coal. This is reduced by 9 and 12tril.US$ to achieve climate stabilization at 550 and 450 ppm CO2-eq, respectively. \nThis loss is, however, overcompensated by revenues from carbon pricing that are 21 and 32tril.US$, respectively. The overcompensation also holds under variations of energy demand and fossil fuel supply. (Bauer et al.)"
