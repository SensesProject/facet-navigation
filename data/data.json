    "Description" : "Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a combination of scenario planning with powerful computing to support decision makers by helping to identify potential strategies that are robust to future unknowns, characterize the vulnerabilities of such strategies, and evaluate tradeoffs among alternatives. In this context, the vulnerabilities of a strategy are the combinations of uncertainties under which it performs poorly. Characterizing vulnerabilities allows for the iterative improvement of the strategy. In the RDM process, scenario discovery is used to uncover the combinations of uncertainties to which the strategy under study is vulnerable",

It is a technique widely used by high-tech industries, where it serves both as a tool for communication, exchange, and development of shared visions, and as a way of communicating expectations about the future to other parties. Roadmaps provide essential understanding of proximity, direction and some degree of certainty in planning. It is a normative and goal oriented method, where attempts are made to achieve a desired future state of development. \n",
