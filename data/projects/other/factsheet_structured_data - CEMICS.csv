CEMICS,guiding questions,preamble,,,"CEMICS is driven by the hypothesis that society will not take decisions on climate engineering (CE) in isolation, but in consideration of the whole portfolio of existing climate policy options. The work within that project puts CE in the context of mitigation by exploring synergies, trade-offs, and side-effects of different CDR methods.
Please note: The project itself investigated the options of CE in a broader context also towards potential synergies or ethical aspects. This research however is not based on scenarios and thus not treated here. "
,,question,,1,How much CDR is at least necessary to achieve the Paris climate targets?
,,question,,2,How does this minimum CDR requirement depend on short-term climate policy and medium-term emission reductions?
,results,preamble,,,"Strefler et al. 2018: There are major concerns about the sustainability of large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. It is therefore an urgent question to what extent CDR will be needed to implement the long-term ambition of the Paris Agreement, and how this depends on short-term climate policy. In this paper we show that ambitious near-term mitigation significantly decreases CDR requirements to keep the Paris climate targets within reach."
,,insight,,1,Following the NDCs until 2030 requires then both fast CO2 emission reductions until 2050 and high amounts of CDR to achieve the 2°C-target. Reducing 2030 emissions by 20% below NDC levels already alleviates the trade-off between high transitional challenges and high CDR deployment.
,,insight,,2,"In order to achieve 2°C entirely without CDR, emissions have to be roughly halved until 2030 and again every decade until 2050."
,,insight,,3,Transitional challenges can only be kept in check if at least 5 Gt CO2/yr CDR are available in any year. At least 8 Gt CO2/yr CDR are necessary in the long term to achieve 1.5°C and more than 15 Gt CO2/yr to keep transitional challenges in bounds.
,,preamble,,,"Kreidenweis et al., 2018 (data is NOT available in any database): This study assessed global and regional food price impacts of afforestation. Afforestation was incentivized by a globally uniform reward for carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere."
,,insight,,1,This resulted in large-scale afforestation (2580 Mha globally) and substantial carbon sequestration (860 GtCO2) up to the end of the century.
,,insight,,2,"However, it was also associated with an increase in food prices of about 80% by 2050 and a more than fourfold increase by 2100. When afforestation was restricted to the tropics the food price response was substantially reduced, while still almost 60% cumulative carbon sequestration was achieved."
