IMAGE 1.5,guiding questions,preamble,,,CDR strategies face several difficulties such as reliance on underground CO2 storage and competition for land with food production and biodiversity protection. The question arises whether alternative deep mitigation pathways exist?
IMAGE 1.5,guiding questions,question,,1,"How essential are bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and other negative-emission technologies for the 1.5 degree target?"
IMAGE 1.5,results,preamble,,,"The study illustrates how a combination of alternative 1.5°C pathways can significantly reduce the need for CDR. They are based on the inclusion of options which are not normally considered in integrated assessment analyses, such as lifestyle change, significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions other than CO2, swift electrification of energy demand and low population growth. While each of these alternatives will still require rapid societal changes and faces its own specific barriers, several also show important synergies with other sustainability goals."
IMAGE 1.5,results,insight,,1,"While this study shows that alternative options can greatly reduce the volume of CDR to achieve the 1.5 °C goal, nearly all scenarios still rely on BECCS and/or reforestation (even the hypothetical combination of all alternative options still captured 400 GtCO2 by reforestation). Therefore, investment in the development of CDR options remains an important strategy if the international community intends to implement the Paris target."
IMAGE 1.5,scenarios,preamble,,,"The study explores alternative pathways leading to a radiative forcing level of 1.9 W m−2 in 2100. The scenarios are all based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2) scenario. In the SSP2 scenario, which forms part of the overall SSP set, middle-of-the-road assumptions have been made for all key model assumptions. The alternative scenarios are developed by implementing narrative-based changes to the input assumptions, mostly in the 2020–2050 period."

This includes a less meat-intensive diet (conforming to health recommendations), less CO2-intensive transport modes (following the current modal split in Japan), less intensive use of heating and cooling (change of 1oC in heating and cooling reference levels) and a reduction in the use of several domestic appliances."
