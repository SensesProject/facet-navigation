,guiding questions,preamble,,,"The PEP project aims to answer crucial questions about the feasibility of 1.5°C scenarios, related to the feasibility of policies - contrasting immediate pricing only and scenarios with gradual ratcheting up of ambition. Further it assesses the implications of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) availability."
,,question,,1,To what extent can plausible bottom-up policy packages (sectoral policies like renewable support or efficiency targets as already observed in a number of countries) that are more ambitous than the NDCs close the emissions gap towards least-cost pathways?
,,question,,2,"Which implementability challenges (grouped into scale, speed, disruption, price impacts and efficiency)are major hurdles for different policy scenarios?"
,,question,,3,"How do they differ between scenarios based on a range of regionally differentiated bottom-up policies and scenarios with a comprehensive and harmonized carbon price only (so called ""first-best"" or ""cost-effective"" scenarios)?"
,,question,,4,What implications follow from the assumption of more strongly limited availability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR)?
,results,preamble,,,The comparison across 3 different dimensions offer a rich exploration of implementability challenges.
,,insight,,1,"A global roll-out of strengthened bottom-up policies could reduce global CO2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO2eq in 2030 compared to NDCs. 
It would lead to emissions pathways close to the levels of cost-effective well below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios until 2030, thereby reducing implementation challenges post 2030. "
,,insight,,2,"Comparing a gradual phase-in of a portfolio of regulatory policies with immediate cost-effective carbon pricing shows that the bottom-up policies might be less disruptive. However, they would perform worse in other dimensions. In particular, they lead to higher economic costs. Hence, such policy packages should not be viewed as alternatives to carbon pricing, but rather as complements that provide entry points to achieve the Paris climate goals."
,,insight,,3,Assuming lower availability of CDR implies faster and more disruptive near-term decarbonization.
,scenarios,preamble,,,"13 scenarios are differentiated along 3 dimensions: Near-term policy, long-term climate target, and assumption on potential  of carbon dioxide removal options (CDR). The 1.5°C target (operationalized as a budget of 400 Gt CO2 2011-2100) is only feasible with assumption of higher availability of CDR or else with immediate cost-effective policy. [Nomenclature: ""x_y_z"" with x either ""1p5C"" for the 400 Gt budget or ""2C"" for the 1000 Gt budget, y for either ""full"" or ""red""uced CDR availability, and z for the near-term policy assumption: ""eff"" means comprehensive pricing from 2025 onwards, ""goodpractice"" for Good practice policies until 2030, ""netzero"" for Net Zero policies until 2030,  and ""NDC"" for NDCs until 2030,  and comprehensive pricing thereafter."

AB  - Climate policy needs to account for political and social acceptance. Current national climate policy plans proposed under the Paris Agreement lead to higher emissions until 2030 than cost-effective pathways towards the Agreements’ long-term temperature goals would imply. Therefore, the current plans would require highly disruptive changes, prohibitive transition speeds, and large long-term deployment of risky mitigation measures for achieving the agreement’s temperature goals after 2030. Since the prospects of introducing the cost-effective policy instrument, a global comprehensive carbon price in the near-term, are negligible, we study how a strengthening of existing plans by a global roll-out of regional policies can ease the implementation challenge of reaching the Paris temperature goals. The regional policies comprise a bundle of regulatory policies in energy supply, transport, buildings, industry, and land use and moderate, regionally differentiated carbon pricing. We find that a global roll-out of these policies could reduce global CO 2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO 2 eq in 2030 compared to current plans. It would lead to emissions pathways close to the levels of cost-effective likely below 2 °C scenarios until 2030, thereby reducing implementation challenges post 2030. Even though a gradual phase-in of a portfolio of regulatory policies might be less disruptive than immediate cost-effective carbon pricing, it would perform worse in other dimensions. In particular, it leads to higher economic impacts that could become major obstacles in the long-term. Hence, such policy packages should not be viewed as alternatives to carbon pricing, but rather as complements that provide entry points to achieve the Paris climate goals.
