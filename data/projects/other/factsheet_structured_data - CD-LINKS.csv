CD-LINKS,guiding questions,preamble,,,"The CD-LINKS project is exploring the complex interplay between climate action and development, while simultaneously taking both global and national perspectives and thereby informing the design of complementary climate-development policies."
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,1,How do national decarbonisation pathways that are collectively consistent with global well-below-2°C pathways look like?
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,2,"How do these low-carbon development pathways for the seven largest greenhouse gas emitters (China, the USA, the EU, India, Russia, Japan and Brazil) compare to each other and which sectoral mitigation measures are deployed?"
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,3,How much achieve currently implemented national policies and submitted NDCs on the way to limit temperature change to 1.5 and 2°C and how large is the emissions gap to cost-effective emissions pathways?
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,4,What are implications of climate policy to achieve the 1.5 and 2°C targets for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,5,"How can adverse effects of climate policies on non-climate SDGs, e.g. on food security, be avoided?"
CD-LINKS,guiding questions,question,,6,What are investment needs to limit temperature rise to 1.5 and 2°C and how do these compare to investment needs to achieve a subset of SDGs?
CD-LINKS,results,preamble,,,"The CD-LINKS scenarios are analyzed from a set of different angles, including consistency of national action with global climate targets, investment needs and sustainable development implicaitons of climate policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. These analyses have been (and are being) published in a series of journal articles, part of which are listed below in relation to the high-level insights. In addition, a full Special Issue with national level analysis in selected G20 countries is currently in preparation."
CD-LINKS,results,insight,,1,"Roelfsema et al.: Seven G20 countries were assessed. Some seem on track to meet NDC targets with current policies, others display an ambition gap. Their NDCs are not on track with cost-efficient emission pathways which limit warming to well below 2°C. Current policies bring a reduction of 2 to 5.5 GtCO2eq. Additional policies and measures are required to fully implement the NDCs, which would reduce emissions by 7 to 17 GtCO2eq.The emissions gap in 2030 between planned national policies and a well below 2°C trajectory are 9 to 37 Gt. For a 1.5°C trajectory there is a gap of 17 to 43 Gt. "
CD-LINKS,results,insight,,2,"Kriegler et al.: Although countries differ considerably in the sectoral composition of emission reductions, a robust pattern emerges, with an almost complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 that is accompanied by accelerated electrification and a limited reduction of carbon intensity of fuel consumption in the industry, buildings and transport sectors."
CD-LINKS,results,insight,,3,"Krey et al.: Climate policies to achieve 1.5 and 2C potentially create both synergies and trade-offs with other SDGs, highlighting that integrated policy approaches are needed to ensure multiple SDGs are achieved simultaneously. In particular, dealing with undesirable distributional consequences of climate policies is key to avoid negative impacts on the poor, like ensuring food security and access to modern energy services."
CD-LINKS,results,insight,,4,McCollum et al.: The Nationally Determined Contributions lack the pronounced reallocation of the investment portfolio needed for transforming the energy system. Charting a course toward ‘well below 2 °C’ instead requires that low-carbon investments overtake fossil investments globally before 2025 and then continue to grow from there. Pursuing the 1.5 °C target demands a marked up-scaling in low-carbon capital beyond that demanded by 2 °C. The investment needs for making progress on certain other SDG targets are small relative to those for energy.

AB  - Low-carbon investments are necessary for driving the energy system transformation that is called for by both the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. Improving understanding of the scale and nature of these investments under diverging technology and policy futures is therefore of great importance to decision makers. Here, using six global modelling frameworks, we show that the pronounced reallocation of the investment portfolio required to transform the energy system will not be initiated by the current suite of countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions. Charting a course toward ‘well below 2 °C’ instead sees low-carbon investments overtaking fossil investments globally by around 2025 or before and growing thereafter. Pursuing the 1.5 °C target demands a marked upscaling in low-carbon capital beyond that of a 2 °C-consistent future. Actions consistent with an energy transformation would increase the costs of achieving the goals of energy access and food security, but reduce the costs of achieving air-quality goals.
