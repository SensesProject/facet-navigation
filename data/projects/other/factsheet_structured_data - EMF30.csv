EMF30,guiding questions,preamble,,,"The EMF30 project is designed to assess the impact of policies aiming at reducing short-lived climate forcers, namely CH4 and BC/OC."
,,question,,1,What is the impact of policies aiming at reducing short-lived climate forcers on emission reductions?
,results,preamble,,,Rauner et al. (in preparation): We find that the health benefits of reduced air pollution of a coal exit by far exceed mitigation costs on a global level. Taking the same coal exit path and additionally introducing a 2°C consistent GHG budget shows that aggregated co-benefits almost compensate the additional cost.
,,insight,,1,Air pollution benefits and mitigation cost are regionally very heterogeneous with India and China yielding most of the resulting synergies.
,,insight,,2,"Synergies are robust under different air pollution legislation scenarios, hence climate policy is a no-regret option for especially Asian countries."
,scenarios,preamble,,,"EMF30 consists of 12 scenarios: 1 reference scenario, 5 diagnostic scenarios and 3 air pollutant scenarios (CH4 policy scenario, BC/OC policy scenario and CH4+BC/OC scenario). The Reference and CH4+BC/OC policy scenarios are further combined with 3 climate policy scenarios (No climate policy, immediate action, slower action (INDC))."

,,scenario,name,4,Slower-Action_V3
,,scenario,description,4,Scenario with slower action on greenhouse gas reductions that replicates near-term developments consistent with the “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDC).
