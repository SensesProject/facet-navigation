AMPERE WP2,project,,,,
AMPERE WP2,guiding questions,preamble,,,The AMPERE project aimed to improve our understanding of possible pathways toward medium- and long-term climate targets at the global and European levels. The project assessed key aspects of the mitigation challenge in a world of delayed and fragmented climate policy. WP2 of AMPERE specifically focused on “Delayed policy action and path dependency in energy systems”
AMPERE WP2,guiding questions,question,,1, How do short-term climate policies impact the achievability of long-term climate targets?
AMPERE WP2,guiding questions,question,,2,What is the role of different technologies and their innovation in meeting long-term climate targets?
AMPERE WP2,results,preamble,,,Delaying global climate mitigation action until 2030 would require an unprecedented and more costly transformation of the global energy system in the decades that follow.
AMPERE WP2,results,insight,,1,"Given the limited remaining carbon budget in order to achieve 2°C, a weak short-term policy results in a majority of the compensation for the delayed action to occur over a twenty-year period between 2030 and 2050. The portion of global energy supplied by low-carbon options would need to quadruple in this period, meaning that almost 50% of the global energy supply infrastructure would need replacement. As a result, mitigation costs would rise between 10-40%, relative to a scenario where immediate action is taken."
AMPERE WP2,results,insight,,2,"Delayed action until 2030 also increases future reliance on specific mitigation options. The longer climate action is delayed, the higher the future dependency on carbon capture and storage (combined with both fossil and biomass) becomes. On the other hand, reducing energy demand by means of increasing energy efficiency contributes towards not only the achievability of the 2°C target, but also results in mitigation cost reductions. Consistently across scenarios, new investments in unabated coal-fired power plants (i.e., without carbon capture and storage, CCS) should be avoided, if ambitious climate goals are to be achieved."
AMPERE WP2,scenarios,preamble,,,"In order to explore the consequences of near-term pledges, the scenarios consider a combination of different short-term and long-term targets, which divide the century-scale time horizon of the scenarios into two stages. During the first stage up to the year 2030, global emissions are required to follow a trajectory toward a 2030 emission target. After 2030, emissions are constrained further to stay within a cumulative emission budget for the full century (2000–2100) in order to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the long-term.  So as to explore sensitivity of the results to different demand assumptions, two contrasting scenarios are used. In the reference case, global energy intensity is following broadly historical rates of improvement, leading to an increase in global energy demand by about a factor of two in 2050. The second scenario is a low energy demand case broadly consistent with the lower bound of demand projections in the literature, depicting stringent efficiency measures and behavioral changes to radically limit energy demand. The rate of energy intensity improvement in the low demand scenario is about 50% higher than the historical rate of changeIn addition to sensitivity cases for energy demand, we explore the feasibility of the transformation for a variety of different supply-side portfolios.  In addition to sensitivity cases for energy demand, the feasibility of the transformation for a variety of different supply-side portfolios is explored. These supply-side cases not only focus on possible restrictions for specific technologies that might arise due to political concerns and public perception, but also on implementation barriers or other concerns

AMPERE WP2 consists of 12 mandatory scenarios in addition to three benchmark scenarios.  
Scenarios differ in terms of:
1.        Long-term climate policy:
           •        Baseline (no climate policy)
           •        450 ppm CO2e (2.0°C)
           •        550 ppm CO2e (3.4°C)
2.        Short-term climate policy (until 2030):
           •        Weak
           •        Strong
3.        Technology portfolio:
           •        Full technology portfolio (default model assumptions)
           •        Energy intensity (high or low energy demand)
           •        Carbon Capture and Storage (available or unavailable)
           •        Nuclear energy (available or unavailable)
           •        Wind and Solar (advanced or conventional)
           •        Bioenergy (high or low potential)

Overarching project (benchmark) scenarios:
•        Baseline, 450ppm and 550ppm scenario + full technology portfolio.
WP2 Scenarios (12):
•        Baseline + low energy intensity
•        Baseline + no nuclear
•        450ppm and 550ppm + full technology options + once with weak and once with strong short term climate policy
•        450ppm + low energy intensity + once with weak and once with strong short term climate policy
•        450ppm + CCS unavailable + once with weak and once with strong short term climate policy
•        450ppm + nuclear unavailable + once with weak and once with strong short term climate policy
Optional sensitivity scenarios cover additional variations of technological as well as long and near-term policy assumptions.
