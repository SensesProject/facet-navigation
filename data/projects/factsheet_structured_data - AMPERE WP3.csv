AMPERE WP3,project,,,,
,guiding questions,preamble,,,"The AMPERE project aimed to improve our understanding of possible pathways toward medium- and long-term climate targets at the global and European levels. The project assessed key aspects of the mitigation challenge in a world of delayed and fragmented climate policy. WP3 specifically focused on fragmented policy regimes and the effects for front-runners.
"
,,question,,1,What impacts do fragmented policy regimes (with a coalition of front-runners and staged accession of others) have on achievability of long-term targets and global energy systems?
,,question,,2,What advantages and disadvantages have the frontrunners and late-comers respectively?
,,question,,3,How much carbon leakage is caused by fragmented policies?
,results,preamble,,,This study explores a situation of staged accession to a global climate policy regime from the current situation of regionally fragmented and moderate climate action. The analysis is based on scenarios in which a front runner coalition – the EU or the EU and China – embarks on immediate ambitious climate action while the rest of the world makes a transition to a global climate regime between 2030 and 2050. We assume that the ensuing regime involves strong mitigation efforts but does not require late joiners to compensate for their initially higher emissions.
,,insight,,1,"Although staged accession can achieve significant reductions of global warming, the resulting climate outcome is unlikely to be consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees. The addition of China to the front runner coalition can reduce pre-2050 excess emissions by 20–30%, increasing the likelihood of staying below2 degrees."
,,insight,,2,"Not accounting for potential co-benefits, the cost of front runner action is found to be lower for the EU than for China."
,,insight,,3,Regions that delay their accession to the climate regime face a trade-off between reduced short term costs and higher transitional requirements due to larger carbon lock-ins and more rapidly increasing carbon prices during the accession period.
,scenarios,preamble,,,"The unique feature about WP3 scenarios are those scenarios with a period of high ambition in front-runner countries (EU or EU and China) and later following of others, as well as ""reconsideration"" scenarios, where front-runners shift back to no climate policy."

 AB - This paper explores a multi-model scenario ensemble to assess the impacts of idealized and non-idealized climate change stabilization policies on fossil fuel markets. Under idealized conditions climate policies significantly reduce coal use in the short- and long-term. Reductions in oil and gas use are much smaller, particularly until 2030, but revenues decrease much more because oil and gas prices are higher than coal prices. A first deviation from optimal transition pathways is delayed action that relaxes global emission targets until 2030 in accordance with the Copenhagen pledges. Fossil fuel markets revert back to the no-policy case: though coal use increases strongest, revenue gains are higher for oil and gas. To balance the carbon budget over the 21st century, the long-term reallocation of fossil fuels is significantly larger—twice and more—than the short-term distortion. This amplifying effect results from coal lock-in and inter-fuel substitution effects to balance the full-century carbon budget. The second deviation from the optimal transition pathway relaxes the global participation assumption. The result here is less clear-cut across models, as we find carbon leakage effects ranging from positive to negative because trade and substitution patterns of coal, oil, and gas differ across models. In summary, distortions of fossil fuel markets resulting from relaxed short-term global emission targets are more important and less uncertain than the issue of carbon leakage from early mover action.
