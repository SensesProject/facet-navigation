,guiding questions,preamble,,,"The study aims to contribute to the understanding of key sustainability impacts of mitigation pathways, and how they can be managed by policy choice in order to maximize benefits and minimize risks."
,,question,,1,What sustainability effects (benefits and risks) does mitigation targets of 2 and 1.5°C imply? 
,,question,,2,How does the choice of mitigation policy paradigm impact the sustainability effects (benefits and risks) of mitigation?
,,question,,3,How do different measures interact?
,results,preamble,,,The study analyses a range of crucial sustainability indicators for 2 different temperature targets achieved by 5 different policy approaches respectively. 
,,insight,,1,"Mitigation leads to a number of sustainability benefits (air pollution, cooling water requirements), but under default policies also leads to severe risks (uranium use, food and energy price increases, land requirements for bioenergy, etc.). Both benefits and risks increase if ambition is raised from 2 to 1.5°C."
,,insight,,2,"A combination of additional policies (direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes) can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change."
,,insight,,3,"Importantly, we find that these targeted policies more than compensate for most increased sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2°C to 1.5°C."

AB  - Meeting the 1.5 °C goal will require a rapid scale-up of zero-carbon energy supply, fuel switching to electricity, efficiency and demand-reduction in all sectors, and the replenishment of natural carbon sinks. These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies—including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes—into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change. Importantly, we find that these targeted policies can more than compensate for most sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2 °C to 1.5 °C.
